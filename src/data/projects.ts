    title: "Crop Yield Forecasting Using Environmental and Soil Data",
    description:
      "Developed a machine learning–based prediction system to forecast crop yield using Random Forest and MinMaxScaler models. The project integrates Flask, Python, Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn to analyze key environmental (rainfall, temperature, humidity) and soil parameters (pH, nutrients, moisture). The system efficiently preprocesses data, applies trained models for accurate yield prediction, and provides actionable insights to support smart and sustainable farming practices.",

    title: "Face Emotion Recognition Using ML",
    description:
      "Developed a real-time facial emotion recognition system using Deep Learning (CNN) and Computer Vision techniques with Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV. The system accurately detects and classifies facial expressions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, and neutral from live webcam input, featuring efficient image preprocessing, face detection, and real-time prediction for enhanced accuracy and performance.",

    title: "School Management System",
    description:
      "Developed a desktop-based School Management System using Python, PyQt5, and MySQL to streamline and automate key academic and administrative processes. The application enables student and teacher registration, attendance tracking, exam and grade management, and includes a secure, role-based login system for administrators and staff. Designed an intuitive PyQt5 interface integrated with a MySQL database via mysql.connector for smooth data handling and real-time updates.",

    description:
      "Designed a custom STM32-based development board using Altium Designer for embedded systems and microcontroller-based applications. Created a comprehensive schematic and a 2-layer PCB layout integrating essential components such as decoupling capacitors, crystal oscillator circuitry, and standard programming/debug interfaces (SWD/UART). Conducted detailed Electrical Rule Checks (ERC) and Design Rule Checks (DRC), optimizing component placement, signal integrity, and routing efficiency to ensure reliable hardware performance.",
